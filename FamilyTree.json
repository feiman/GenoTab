        "$Title":"Harry Potter Family Tree",
        "$Description":"From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter\n=====================================\nHarry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by the British author J. K. Rowling. The books chronicle the adventures of a wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's quest to overcome the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort, whose aims are to become immortal, conquer the wizarding world, subjugate non-magical people, and destroy all those who stand in his way, especially Harry Potter.\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.[2] The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern for the increasingly dark tone. As of June 2011, the book series has sold about 450 million copies, making it the best-selling book series in history, and has been translated into 67 languages.[3][4] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.\nA series of many genres, including fantasy, coming of age, and the British school story (with elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, and romance), it has many cultural meanings and references.[5][6][7][8] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[9] There are also many other themes in the series, such as prejudice and corruption.[10]\nThe series was originally printed in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. The books have since been published by many publishers worldwide. The books, with the seventh book split into two parts, have been made into an eight-part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, the highest-grossing film series of all time. The series also originated much tie-in merchandise, making the Harry Potter brand worth in excess of $15 billion.[11] Also, due to the success of the books and films, Harry Potter has been used for a theme park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Parks & Resorts' Islands of Adventure.\nContents [show]\nPlot\nFurther information: Harry Potter universe\nThe novels revolve around Harry Potter, an orphan who discovers at the age of eleven that he is a wizard, living within the ordinary world of non-magical people, or Muggles.[12] His ability is inborn and such children are invited to attend a school that teaches the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world.[13] Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is here where most of the novels' events take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships and exams, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead.[14]\nEach book chronicles one year in Harry's life[15] with the main narrative being set in the years 1991–98.[16] The books also contain many flashbacks, which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a Pensieve.\nThe environment Rowling created is completely separate from reality yet intimately connected to it. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternative universe and the Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life. Many of its institutions and locations are recognisable, such as London.[17] It comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles that remain invisible to the Muggle population.[13]\nEarly years\nWhen the first novel of the series Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in some countries as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, it is clear some remarkable event has taken place in the wizarding world, an event so very remarkable, even the Muggles notice signs of it. The full background to this event and to the person of Harry Potter is only revealed gradually, through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his background begins to be revealed.\nHarry's first contact with the wizarding world is through a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of grounds and keys at Hogwarts. Hagrid reveals some of Harry's history.[18] Harry learns that as a baby he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, who then attempted to kill him also.[18] For reasons not immediately revealed, the spell with which Voldemort tried to kill Harry rebounded. Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle (non-wizard) relatives, the Dursleys, who had him safe but hid his true heritage from him in hopes that he would grow up \"normal\".[18]\nWith Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but hard-up wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.[18][19] Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a deep and abiding dislike for him. The plot concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that gives everlasting life.[18]\nThe series continues with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears tied to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, enrols in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds a notebook which turns out to be Voldemort's diary from his school days. Ginny becomes possessed by Voldemort through the diary and opens the \"Chamber of Secrets\", unleashing an ancient monster which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. The novel delves into the history of Hogwarts and a legend revolving around the Chamber. For the first time, Harry realises that racial prejudice exists in the wizarding world, and he learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards who were descended from Muggles. Harry also learns that his ability to speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes, is rare and often associated with the Dark Arts. The novel ends after Harry saves Ginny's life by destroying a basilisk and the enchanted diary which has been the source of the problems.\nThe third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped murderer believed to have assisted in the deaths of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors—dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul—which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally shown by people his age. Harry learns that both Lupin and Black were close friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew.[20] In this book, another recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised—in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.\nVoldemort returns\n\"The Elephant House\", a small, painted red café where Rowling wrote a few chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\"The Elephant House\" – The café in Edinburgh in which Rowling wrote the first part of Harry Potter.\nDuring Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard \"champion\" from visiting schools as well as another Hogwarts student.[21] Harry is guided through the tournament by Professor Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, who turns out to be an impostor – one of Voldemort's supporters named Barty Crouch, Jr in disguise. The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed and Voldemort re-enters the wizarding world with a physical body.\nIn the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the Ministry of Magic and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned.[22] In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.[22]\nHarry forms \"Dumbledore's Army\", a secret study group to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is revealed,[23] and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically. In the novel's climax, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort's Death Eaters. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the children's lives, Sirius Black is killed in the conflict.[22]\nIn the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence; Harry eventually begins dating Ginny Weasley. Near the beginning of the novel, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer, \"the Half-Blood Prince\". This book is a source of scholastic success, but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort. These reveal that Voldemort, to preserve his life, has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of horcruxes, evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.[24] Harry's snobbish adversary, Draco Malfoy, attempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. As they search for the horcruxes, the trio learns details about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives—he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother.\nThe book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various magical creatures. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle. After learning that he himself is a horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort, who casts a killing curse at him. However, the defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning this, but continue to fight on. Having managed to return from the dead, Harry finally faces Voldemort, whose horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the subsequent battle, Voldemort's curse rebounds off of Harry's spell and kills Voldemort. An epilogue describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects on the wizarding world."

Petunia and Vernon agreed to raise Harry, but kept him as downtrodden as possible in order to squash the magic out of him; they never told him how his parents died, instead claiming they had died in a car crash.\nWhen Petunia and her husband, Vernon, attempted to throw Harry out of their house at the beginning of Order of the Phoenix, she receives a Howler from Dumbledore – \"Remember my last, Petunia\", which JKR has confirmed is referring to the note he left with one-year-old Harry on their doorstep. Rowling has also said that Dumbledore had corresponded with Petunia before that. Aunt Petunia has, therefore, more knowledge about the wizarding world than she will admit.

Voldemort, seeking to restore his physical form, entered Quirrell as a host body, using him in a plan to steal the Philosopher's Stone from vault 713 in Gringotts Bank, where it had been deposited for safekeeping by Albus Dumbledore. Fortunately, Hagrid had removed the Stone from the vault earlier that same day to take it to Hogwarts.\nTo conceal the fact that Lord Voldemort's face was on the back of his head, Quirrell decided to wear the turban, hiding its purpose with a story that it had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. In order to keep Voldemort alive, he started killing unicorns in the Forbidden Forest and drinking their blood.\nOn Halloween Quirrell let the troll in as a diversion, and went to the third-floor corridor where the Stone was now hidden. Severus Snape, who already suspected Quirrell, went to the third floor in order to stop him. Snape was bitten by Fluffy.\nIn order to figure out how to get past Fluffy, Quirrell got Hagrid drunk, and gave him a dragon's egg, something Hagrid had always wanted. Quirrell sent a letter to Dumbledore, telling him to go to the Ministry of Magic; Quirrell took advantage of his absence to try to reach the Stone, and was pursued - unwittingly, as they thought they were pursuing Snape - by Harry, Ron and Hermione.\nDuring Harry's final encounter with him - at which Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head and speaks directly to Harry - Quirrell is killed. Due to the lingering protection from Lily Potter's sacrifice of love for her son, Quirrell is unable to touch Harry without suffering extreme pain. Although Harry is rendered unconscious, he holds off Quirrell long enough for aid to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees in his spirit form. His departure causes Quirrell's death, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies."

On one occasion, Riddle questioned Slughorn about Horcruxes, artifacts which could act as vessels for pieces of a person's soul in order to grant immortality. Having learnt of the nature of Horcruxes, Riddle went on to perform the necessary Dark magic to create his own Horcruxes, which contributed to his formidable power in his later reign of terror under his assumed name of Lord Voldemort."

Her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of making repeated predictions each year that one of her students will die - pronouncements which have never yet come true.\nIn Harry's third year (his first in Divination), Trelawney began to predict his imminent demise. During every class thereafter, she continued to insinuate that his death could come at any time, to the great irritation of Harry and his friends. Eventually, in part due to this habit of Trelawney's, Hermione dropped the class. Harry and Ron continued Divination studies until their fifth year, at the end of which they failed the exams and could not continue further - although neither was upset about this.\nIn 1996, Professor Trelawney was put on probation by Dolores Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor. This news pushed Trelawney into a spiral of alcohol-induced paranoia, and she was subsequently seen around the school clutching a bottle of cooking sherry and moaning about her victimisation at Umbridge's hands.\nHer fears were proved justified when Umbridge dismissed Trelawney, although Dumbledore exercised his remaining authority as Headmaster to prevent Umbridge from evicting Trelawney to boot. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that Dumbledore feared for Trelawney's safety if she ventured outside the school, since Lord Voldemort would probably want to obtain from her the prediction she made concerning him. Dumbledore employed a centaur named Firenze as Trelawney's replacement. Trelawney was reinstated after Umbridge was ousted from the school and returned to the Ministry of Magic. Much to her displeasure, Trelawney now shared responsibility for teaching Divination with Firenze."

He is completely spoiled, and he gets a horrible delight in bullying smaller kids, and shows a complete lack of sensitivity; he is also a glutton.\nDudley has been thoroughly spoiled since birth, getting mountains of birthday and Christmas presents and then throwing a tantrum because he wanted more, being given two bedrooms in the house, never using one, and then screaming when it is given to Harry and generally given his way in almost everything. He shows the symptoms of a brat from his first year itself, when a disgusted Professor McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she saw the toddler Dudley kicking his mother and screaming for sweets.\nA rude, belligerent and selfish boy, Dudley is quite an unlikable character, although he knows how to be polite when he wants to make an impression (notably when his father's business associate came for dinner one evening). It can be inferred that he and Harry went to a private prep school in Surrey together, where Dudley and his gang of bullies ruled the school, and where the rest of the students shunned Harry as they knew Dudley hated him. With each passing year Dudley was overindulged in every way by his parents, which eventually made his morbidly obese and a careless student (he had reached the height and weight of a young killer whale at the beginning of the fourth book). Throughout their childhood together, Dudley would take any opportunity he could to humiliate and torment his cousin, Harry. Unlike his cousin, however, Dudley has no powers outside of his brutishness.",

When the group discovered that Lupin was a werewolf, they studied secretly to become Animagi in solidarity with Lupin, to keep him company during his transformations.\nWhen the Potters went into hiding from Voldemort, they wanted to make Sirius their Secret-Keeper, but at the last minute he convinced them to appoint Pettigrew to the task instead, since no one would suspect such a move. Pettigrew immediately betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, and during the subsequent confrontation with Sirius, caused an explosion to fake his own death, killing twelve nearby Muggle bystanders in the process. Sirius was left framed for Pettigrew's \"murder\" and those of the bystanders, as well as the Potters' betrayal. In light of the overwhelming evidence against him, his guilt was assumed so completely (in particular by the ruthless Barty Crouch) that he was sent straight to Azkaban without trial and imprisoned there for twelve years, during which he endured relentless mental torture at the hands of the Azkaban guards, the dementors.\nHis later escape from prison led to the widest manhunt ever in the wizarding world (being the first person known to have escaped Azkaban, though in reality, he is second to Barty Crouch, Jr.), and he fled Europe for a time, only to return on Dumbledore's orders in The Order of the Phoenix, where he was forced to stay in his old family home, Grimmauld Place. It was impossible for The Order to reveal his location and prove him innocent for various reasons. His death at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, in the Ministry itself, led to Dumbledore explaining his story to the Minister of Magic. Tragically, Sirius was only recognized as innocent after his death.",

She introduces herself to Harry on the Hogwarts Express and invites him to join the group in her compartment, but not without making snide remarks about Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, whom she considers \"uncool.\" Harry stands up for his friends and refuses her invitation. Later in the year she attempts to trick Harry into taking a love potion, but while he takes the box of chocolates she gives him, he is wise enough not to eat them. Several months later, Ron Weasley accidentally eats several of Romilda's doctored chocolates and is affected by the love potion, forcing Harry to take him to Professor Slughorn for an antidote - which leads to Ron being poisoned by accident. Following Gryffindor's Quidditch victory towards the end of the book, Romilda is outraged to see Harry kissing Ginny Weasley, whom he starts dating shortly thereafter.",

Crouch's mother later died and was buried under his name. His father kept him under control with the Imperius Curse and forced him to hide under an invisibility cloak at all times. Crouch was nursed back to health by Winky, the family's House-Elf. Bertha Jorkins discovered the truth, and years later it reached Lord Voldemort. He rescued Crouch and put his father under the Imperius Curse. Crouch then kidnapped Mad-Eye Moody and, with the help of the polyjuice potion, took over Moody's job of teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. His father was later killed by Crouch himself.\nCrouch planned to succeed where his master had failed, but also failed to kill Harry. Under the influence of Veritaserum, a powerful truth potion, he recounted his plan and his intentions throughout the year. He was to be watched over so that he could give his testimony later, but instead, before he could come to trial, he had his soul sucked out by Dementor's Kiss. It is important to note that he is still technically alive, but one would hardly dare to identify what he has been reduced to as \"alive.\" It is never revealed what happened to him after he had his soul sucked out, but it is assumed he either died or was sent back to Azkaban."

However, he betrayed the Potters to Voldemort in order to gain the Dark Lord's favour. During the confrontation with Sirius on that fateful night, it was actually Pettigrew who blasted the muggles and then transformed himself to escape with the other rats down into the sewers. He left behind a finger, successfully faking his own death and framing Black for his and the Potters' deaths."

In appearance he's a small old man dressed in wildly coloured clothing. He's capable of flight and intangibility, like ghosts, but can also affect solid objects and make himself invisible.\nHe's usually far more annoying than legitimately dangerous, but acts in a wildly unpredictable manner and should not be given the chance to cause serious harm. It appears that his entire purpose is to cause disorder, break things, and be as annoying and disruptive as possible.\nPeeves does not listen to Hogwarts prefects, teachers or anyone else, with the exception of Dumbledore and for some unknown reason the fearsome Bloody Baron. Argus Filch, who is usually left with cleaning up the mess and the damage Peeves causes, is his nemesis and works continuously to try to get Peeves thrown out."
